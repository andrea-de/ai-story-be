The cold bars press against your trembling fingers, and as you slowly adjust to your surroundings, the weight of a haunting realization settles upon you. Blood stains your hands, although you cannot remember how it got there. The metallic scent of fear pervades the air, growing more potent with each passing minute. Panic consumes you, driving your mind into overdrive as you desperately search for answers. Time becomes an enigmatic enemy, ticking away while you struggle to piece together the fragments of your memory.",

Heart pounding, you move slowly, methodically, willing your hands to find a glimmer of hope in this darkness. Suddenly, your trembling fingers encounter a small latch, hidden within the cracks. Eagerly, you grasp onto it, praying it leads to freedom as your hands pull, revealing a faint sliver of light that seeps into your prison cell.",

Panic consumes you once more, tears mingling with the blood on your hands. The truth remains elusive, haunting your every thought as the darkness engulfs you once again, trapping you within its unforgiving grasp."
